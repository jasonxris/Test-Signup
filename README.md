# Test-Signup Google Form/Sheet/Script

Google applications are able to be customized using [google script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview). 
This application is a customization of a google form. It allows the form to restrict who can submit data. This is a function that google
form already provides, but will restrict the form to only users with google accounts. This script and form combination allows submissions to be 
restricted to one email, even if it is not associated with a google account
